1)# 😊😢 Emotion Detection – Happy vs. Sad Classifier

This project is a binary image classification model built using TensorFlow and Keras to detect human emotions—specifically distinguishing between **happy** and **sad** facial expressions.

## 📌 Overview

- 🧠 Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- 
- 🔍 Binary classificaation of images as **Happy** or **Sad**
- ⚙️ TensorFlow/Keras used for modeling
- 🖼️ Image preprocessing handled via ImageDataGenerator or tf.data
- 📊 Accuracy evaluated on validation set and new test images
- 🗂️ Dataset stored on Google Drive
- 💾 Trained model saved as `img_classifier.keras`
